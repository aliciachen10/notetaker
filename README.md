# Notetaker App



# Description
Notetaker app enables you to take notes with an Express.js backend. it's a full-stack application that showcases usage of frontend html/css, Javascript, and an Express backend that adds your notes to a database and retrieves those notes from a database to then display.. I created the backend routing for this application to supplement the pre-written html/css and javascript frontend. This app can be accessed on heroku, or by cloning the project, npm install express, and running on your local server.
